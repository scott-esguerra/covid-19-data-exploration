# covid-19-data-exploration

The dataset is built within the 207 country profiles which allows us to explore the statistics on the coronavirus pandemic for every nation in the world. I used two .cvs files named covid_deaths and covid_vaccinations that you can see or download in the repository. The data in this study only comprises entries starting January 2020 to March 2021.
The complete COVID-19 dataset is a collection of the COVID-19 data maintained by Our World in Data.  The complete description of each column and data sources are present in GitHub.
